                                    For this project, I was inspired by Valentines Day. I always get my partner flowers, and we play Minecraft together, so I thought I would give him a Minecraft flower! When you drop items in the game, they kind of go spinny spinny until you pick them up, so I thought it was a good opportunity to incorporate some circuitry into my gift to him. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The flower (a Minecraft oxeye daisy) was laser cut and hand-painted (unfortunately, the lab didn't have white paint to finish it). The box was stolen from the depths of the fabrication lab. A yellow DC motor is glued to lid of the box, with a small hole on top to reveal the knob of a petentiometer and the axle of the motor. The pententiometer is wired to act as a variable resistor on the motor, controlling its rpm. And that's really it! It's very simple, since I'm very new to fabrication in general. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                   I'm embarrassed to say that this project idea didn't work out, but I thought it was worth documenting. My first idea was to cut a plane, attach it to a motor, and then have it go around in circles. I ended up getting a little lazy with the laser cutting, so I ended up not going with this idea. I swapped out the plane (design below) with a hand so that the kinetic sculpture would become (depending on your mood) a high-five machine or face-slapping machine. 
                                   <br>
                                   <br>
                                   Anyways. The idea was that it'd be wired up in the same way as the minecraft flower project. The only difference was that, because I needed the hand to move in a circle, I needed to engineer a small key that would lock onto the axle of the motor. In the end, the hand was a little bit heavy, and making a container for the motor that needed such a wide berth ended up being too much work for the time I had this week. I was not as happy with my assignment for this week, even though my partner enjoyed it, so I'm hoping to do something more complex and fun next week.

                                <p>Here's the flower in action. As we noticed in class, the relationship between the petentiometer and the rpm of the motor is NOT linear, and adjustments were very small and almost unnoticeable. If you pay attention, though, it does its thing. The inside was a bit messy and my cable management was lacking; I didn't go through the effort to glue things down since I would want to use the breadboard and the ESP32 for future projects.

                                Sorry, I will upload the appropriate photos soon! Had some issues with that.
