                    <p class="subtitle-text">
                        This is a 6-week preparatory course for the AMC 8 exam. The AMC 8 exam s a math contest
                        organized by
                        the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). It is primarily for students in Grade 8 and
                        below.
                        High-scoring students have the opportunity to qualify for the AMC 10 exam, which is primarily
                        meant
                        for students between Grade 8 and Grade 10. The goal of this course is to provide students a
                        mathematical foundation for the AMC 8, expose them to competitive math test-taking strategies,
                        and
                        prepare them through both theory and practice.

                            <h4>Curriculum</h4>
                            <p>This is a 6-week program, and the curriculum is tailored towards students who have not
                                prepared for the AMC 8 before. Sessions will ideally be 90 minutes (with a short break)
                                but
                                can be adjusted in length and frequency to match student needs. To help me provide a
                                more
                                tailored curriculum, students can fill out the form attached on the sign-up page.
                                Depending
                                on student needs, the course can be extended, and sessions can be lengthened. You can
                                find
                                the preliminary syllabus <a href="../files/Syllabus.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                            <h4>Resources</h4>
                            <p>One of the leading sources on American mathematics competitions is the Art of Problem
                                Solving (AoPS), an organization which develops courses and books preparing students for
                                competitive mathematics, physics, programming, and more. For this course, we will be
                                utilizing "Volume 1: The Basics" by AoPS. This book provides a good balance of both
                                theory and practice and was written by past competition winners, writers, and educators.
                                The table of contents should be visible to the right and is also available on the
                                official website.
                                <br><br>
                                You can purchase the book and its solutions <a
                                    href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/aops-vol1">here</a>. Ideally,
                                students should not have access to the solutions until I release them. While purchasing
                                the workbook is encouraged, it is not required for this course. I will provide relevant
                                chapters, exercises, and solutions as needed. Students can expect to have access to the
                                content needed for this course electronically, but no more than that.

                                please have the student fill out the forms below. Note that this step will take approximately 50 minutes total and will help make the course a better experience for everyone involved.</p>

                                    the 2005 AMC 8 exam, which we will use as a baseline for the students' performance.
                                    Please have the student take the exam under real test conditions, as outlined in the
                                    form. Once they submit their answers to the form, they will automatically be graded.
                                    Students can expect 1 exam per week, and, by the end of the 6 weeks, we will be able
                                    to qualitatively describe their progress! This will take 40 minutes to complete, and

                                    will allow me to make the course more or less rigorous dependent on their needs.
